This is an implementation of the API needed in the code challenge https://github.com/engagetech/backend-coding-challenge for EngageTech.

The task
========

Imagine that you come back from 2 weeks of holidays on a Monday. On the team scrum board, assigned to you, two tasks await :

User story 1:
------------

As a user, i want to be able to enter my expenses and have them saved for later.

As a user, in the application UI, I can navigate to an expenses page. On this page, I can add an expense, setting :

The date of the expense

The value of the expense

The reason of the expense

When I click "Save Expense", the expense is then saved in the database. The new expense can then be seen in the list of submitted expenses.

User story 2:
------------

As a user, I want to be able to see a list of my submitted expenses.

As a user, in the application UI, i can navigate to an expenses page. On this page, I can see all the expenses I already submitted in a tabulated list. On this list, I can see :

The date of the expense

The VAT (Value added tax) associated to this expense. VAT is the UKâ€™s sales tax. It is 20% of the value of the expense, and is included in the amount entered by the user.

The reason of the expense
